# WeightCalc

I have created 2 webpages, to help me track down my weight loss and keep me motivated everyday when I enter my new weight.

One page for my desktop and the other is for my cellphone.

I used **JavaScript** to create them.

The only problem I had was editing the data in both files every week.

And that was **exhausting**.

So I have created a **python3 script** to help me, so when I edit the data every time in much clearer file: **data.py** and I run the **main.py** the **script** will output 2 html files, 1 for the desktop and the other for my cellphone. 

You can try them youself:
